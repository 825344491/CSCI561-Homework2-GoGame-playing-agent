# Go-game playing agent based on Min-Max alpha-beta pruning algorithm with heuristics
 - Implemented an AI Go-game playing agent that can play Go-games by using Min-Max decision algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to search the possible state space and choose the best move to its best knowledge.
 - Heuristic method was used to decide whether the current state is advantageous to the agent or not, and how advantageous it is.
